My testing Repo. 

Building an interactive platform for backtesting algoritms in an interactive way, 
and hopefuly learn something on the way. 

I want to host this server on an raspberry pi, and eventully cluster, and after that AI cluster.

Using bayesian interference for exit and % stop loss strategy. 
Then using strategy for "price prediction"

Stage 1: 

Building the interactive platform. My first try will be with streamlit library.



Files:
    
    * SRC - Source code, think test.py
        Source code to my project.


    * Backtest
        Classes, funktions, and so on.
    

    * data
        Daily data from omxs30.
        "omxs_new.csv" - starts where volume also is accounted for.

    
    * venv
        Enviorment to have correct updates on scripts, reduce bugges when uppdating.
            commands:
            pip install -r requirements.txt     --      Creates txt files with correct versions on scripts.
            .\.venv\Scripts\activate            --      Starts venv.
            deactivate                          --      Stops venv.


Libraries:

    * Streamlit
        A python library for building the interactive platform.

    * Numpy


    * Pandas
        Data storage & dataframes.

    * Matplotlib


    * Plotly
        Easy lib to build interactive plot.
