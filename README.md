My testing Repo. 

Building an interactive platform for backtesting algoritms in an interactive way, 
and hopefuly learn something on the way. 


Stage 1: 

Building the interactive platform. My first try will be with streamlit library.



Files:
    
    * SRC - Source code, think test.py
        Source code to my project.


    * Backtest
        Classes, funktions, and so on.
    

    * data
        Daily data from omxs30.
            Temp: datahandling - if data needs cleaning.

    
    * venv
        Enviorment to have correct updates on scripts, reduce bugges when uppdating.
            commands:
            pip install -r requirements.txt     --      Creates txt files with correct versions on scripts.
            .\.venv\Scripts\activate            --      Starts venv.
            deactivate                          --      Stops venv.


Libraries:

    * Streamlit
        A python library for building the interactive platform.

    * Numpy


    * Pandas


    * Matplotlib


    * Plotly?
